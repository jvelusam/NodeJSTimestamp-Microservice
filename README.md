# Timestamp Microservice

This is a solution to the [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice) backend certification project from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

## Overview

### The Challenge

User Stories

- A request to /api/:date? with a valid date should return a JSON object with a unix key that is a Unix timestamp of the input date in milliseconds.
- A request to /api/:date? with a valid date should return a JSON object with a utc key that is a string of the input date in the format: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT.
- A request to /api/1451001600000 should return { unix: 1451001600000, utc: "Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT" }.
- Your project can handle dates that can be successfully parsed by new Date(date_string).
- If the input date string is invalid, the api returns an object having the structure { error : "Invalid Date" }.
- An empty date parameter should return the current time in a JSON object with a unix key.
- An empty date parameter should return the current time in a JSON object with a utc key.

## My Process

### Built With

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com)

### What I Learned

- How the requests are handled in a server, which the ExpressJS makes easy.
- How the responses are generated and handled for a request.
- How to create routes for specific requests.
- How the date and time formats are handled.

### Continued Development

I will be focussing more on the basic level JavaScript and its various functions, because this project really taught how the basic and fundamental functions can help.
